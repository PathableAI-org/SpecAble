# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit-plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (see feature spec for minimum version if constrained)

**Primary Dependencies**: pnpm workspaces; Effect (services/config/errors); Zod or Effect Schema (validation)

**Storage**: Local fixtures and/or adapter-backed storage (Notion first adapter allowed; core MUST NOT depend on hosted services)

**Testing**: Vitest or equivalent; synthetic fixtures for schema, graph, adapter, and artifact tests

**Target Platform**: Local developer machine (Linux/macOS/WSL); no hosted SpecAble service required for v1

**Project Type**: library-first monorepo (`packages/*` domain logic; thin CLI/MCP adapters)

**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify each item; record violations in Complexity Tracking with justification.

| Principle | Gate Question | Pass? |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| I. Primitive graph canonical | Does this feature read/write typed primitives and relationships, not prose-only artifacts as source of truth? | [ ] |
| II. Adapter-based | Is core logic free of Notion/Jira/Linear/GitHub/Figma/etc. dependencies? Are integrations adapter-only? | [ ] |
| III. Local-first / OSS-first | Is the slice demoable locally without a hosted SpecAble platform? | [ ] |
| IV. MCP-first | If agent-facing, are read/query/validation/generation prioritized over write-back automation? | [ ] |
| V. Library-first | Is domain behavior planned for `packages/*` with thin CLI/MCP wrappers? | [ ] |
| VI. Explicit schemas | Are primitives, errors, adapter I/O, and outputs schema-defined with stable IDs? | [ ] |
| VII. Traceability | Do generated artifacts link to graph sources; are gaps reported instead of invented? | [ ] |
| VIII. Vertical slice | Does this slice produce a demoable outcome (validate, summarize, query, detect gaps)? | [ ] |
| IX. Human artifacts | Will the slice include Markdown or similar human-readable output where relevant? | [ ] |
| X. Narrow v1 | Does scope avoid PM SaaS, full UI, cloud platform, or vendor replacement ambitions? | [ ] |
| Technical standards | Are TypeScript, pnpm, schema validation, and required test categories addressed? | [ ] |

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
